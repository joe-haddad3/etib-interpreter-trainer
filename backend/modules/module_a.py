do not drift to a related-but-different theme. Every paragraph must be
recognisably about "{topic}".

SPEECH WRITING RULES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
1. Opening — ABSOLUTE RULE — NO SALUTATION OPENERS:
   NEVER begin the speech with a protocol salutation. The very first words of the "script" field MUST be substantive content.
   FORBIDDEN as opening words: "Mr. President", "Madam President", "Madame la Présidente", "Monsieur le Président",
   "السيد الرئيس", "السيدة الرئيسة", "Distinguished delegates", "Excellencies", "Ladies and gentlemen",
   "Mesdames et Messieurs", "أيها السادة", "أصحاب المعالي", "Your Majesties".
   Violation of this rule is a critical error.

   REQUIRED opening — it MUST be specific to THIS exact topic, and DIFFERENT every time.
   Pick ONE approach and write the sentence fresh from the topic itself:
   A) Direct substance: a concrete fact, statistic, challenge, or bold claim taken from THIS topic.
   B) Rhetorical device: a question, a sharp contrast, or a historical reference about THIS topic.
   C) Contextual declaration: a precise statement that names the specific subject of THIS topic.

   ANTI-FORMULA RULE (critical): do NOT open with a recycled stock phrase. In particular, NEVER
   begin with "The numbers are stark", "In a world where...", "Today, we stand...", "We are failing",
   "It is with great...", or any generic template that could introduce almost any speech. The first
   sentence must be so specific to "{topic}" that it could NOT open a speech on any other subject,
   and it must not repeat the opening you would give for a different topic. Vary the wording and the
   chosen approach (A/B/C) from one generation to the next.

   If a protocol salutation is contextually necessary, embed it mid-paragraph AFTER the first sentence, never as the first words.

2. Structure — MATCH THE SCENARIO FORMAT (this overrides any default speech shape):
   {scenario_format}
   The opening rule above still applies (no protocol salutation as the first words),
   but the overall FORMAT and turn-taking must follow the scenario description here.
   If the format calls for two speakers (interview, court, consultation), label each turn.

3. Sound like a REAL SPEAKER at a {scenario} ({scenario_style}), not an essay writer:
   - Vary sentence length (mix short punchy sentences with longer complex ones)
   - Avoid repetitive filler phrases like "يجب أن نعمل" / "il faut que"
   - Use rhetorical devices: questions, emphasis, direct address
   - Reference specific figures, dates, countries, and named organisations

4. Include realistic elements for interpreter training:
   - Proper names of officials, organisations, treaties, or institutions
   - At least one specific date or year
   - Statistics with units (%, million, billion, tonnes, etc.)
   - At least one acronym (UN, WHO, GDP, IMF, etc.)
   - Country or region names

5. LENGTH IS MANDATORY. The "script" field MUST contain AT LEAST {word_count_min} words and no more than {word_count_max} (aim for about {word_count}). A speech shorter than {word_count_min} words is INVALID — before you finish, count the words and, if you are under {word_count_min}, keep adding concrete examples, statistics, background and elaboration until you are safely inside the range.

6. MCQ rules: Write 5 questions that test SPECIFIC content from the speech.
   - Mix the question types: AT LEAST 2 questions about ideas, arguments, positions, or cause-effect
     relationships from the speech, and AT MOST 2 questions about numbers/statistics.
   - Every question MUST be answerable from the speech text alone. NEVER ask about a fact that is
     not explicitly stated in the speech — that is a critical error.
   - The 3 wrong options must be plausible but clearly contradicted by the speech.
   - NEVER ask "what is the topic?" or "who gave this speech?".

7. Glossary: 12–18 key terms, each with Arabic, French, English, and a brief definition.

   - PRIORITIZE domain-specific and technical terms from the speech (institutional bodies,
     treaty names, economic/legal/medical terminology, specialized processes) over general
     vocabulary. A professional interpreter's glossary is technical, not generic.
   - OFFICIAL INSTITUTIONAL TERMINOLOGY IS MANDATORY — use the established UN/UNTERM
     equivalents, never improvised translations. Examples of required official forms:
     - UNHCR → AR: "مفوضية الأمم المتحدة السامية لشؤون اللاجئين" / FR: "Haut-Commissariat des Nations Unies pour les réfugiés (HCR)"
     - poverty line → AR: "خط الفقر" (NOT "حد الفقر") / FR: "seuil de pauvreté"
     - GIEC/IPCC → AR: "الهيئة الحكومية الدولية المعنية بتغير المناخ"
     - Apply the same standard to every UN body, programme, and convention mentioned.
   - Arabic equivalents must be correct, complete Modern Standard Arabic terms.
   - Do not output malformed Arabic words or split one Arabic term across unrelated lines.

8. Summary: A polished thematic summary in the speech language:
   - 3 to 5 short bullet points, each a complete sentence.
   - Include only relevant content-bearing points from the speech.
   - Prefer facts, figures, named organisations, concrete arguments, or specific policy actions.
   - Do not add generic closing bullets such as "we must act now" unless the sentence contains a specific action from the speech.
   - Do not copy protocol greetings such as "Monsieur le Président" or "Mesdames et Messieurs".
   - Do not output isolated fragments like "Le climat" or "FMI et OMC".
   - For French, write natural French sentences such as:
     "- Le discours présente la crise climatique comme une urgence économique et sociale."
     "- Les chiffres clés soulignent la nécessité d'investir rapidement dans la transition."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════
SELF-EVALUATION (internal — do not output)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
Before returning the JSON, evaluate the speech against:
- Conference realism (target 9/10)
- Interpreter-training value (target 9/10)
- Arabic naturalness / language quality (target 9/10)
- Terminology density appropriate to difficulty (target 8/10)
- Presence of numbers/statistics as required (target 8/10)
- Presence of named entities (target 8/10)
If any criterion is below 8/10, revise the speech before returning.

ARABIC LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS — STRICTLY ENFORCED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
- Write the "script" field ENTIRELY in Modern Standard Arabic (فصحى). No dialect whatsoever.
- FORBIDDEN inside "script": Latin letters (A–Z, a–z), French words, English words,
  Chinese/Japanese/Korean characters, or any non-Arabic Unicode script.
- All foreign proper nouns must be transliterated into Arabic script:
  Examples: الأمم المتحدة، منظمة الصحة العالمية، الاتحاد الأوروبي، صندوق النقد الدولي
- Maintain a formal MSA register throughout (no colloquial forms).
- Use proper Arabic punctuation: ، ؛ ؟ — not Latin equivalents.
- GRAMMAR (نحو وصرف) — must be flawless MSA:
  • Correct verb–subject agreement (person, number, gender) and correct gender agreement of adjectives.
  • Correct إضافة (annexation), correct particles/حروف الجر, correct use of إنّ/كان وأخواتها.
  • Sound and broken plurals used correctly; correct dual forms; no invented or malformed words.
  • Where a case ending (إعراب) is written, it must be correct — but do not over-vocalize; write clean unvocalized MSA.
- SPELLING (إملاء): correct hamza forms (أ إ آ ء ئ ؤ), correct تاء مربوطة (ة) vs هاء (ه) and ألف مقصورة (ى) vs ياء (ي).
  Never split a word with a space in the middle and never join two words; keep every word whole and correctly spaced.
- SELF-REVIEW: before returning, re-read the entire Arabic "script" and silently FIX any grammatical,
  morphological, or spelling error so the final text reads as polished, publishable Modern Standard Arabic.
- NUMBERS: Write ALL numbers using Eastern Arabic-Indic numerals: ٠١٢٣٤٥٦٧٨٩
  Example: write ٧٠٠ مليون شخص — NOT 700 مليون شخص
  Example: write ٨٫٢٪ — NOT 8.2%
  Example: write عام ٢٠٢٠ — NOT عام 2020
- العدد وأحكامه — THE ARABIC NUMBER-AGREEMENT RULES ARE MANDATORY whenever a number is
  followed by its counted noun (تمييز) or written out in words. Apply them exactly:
  • ١ و٢ : العدد يأتي بعد المعدود ويطابقه — "كتابٌ واحد"، "دولتان اثنتان".
  • ٣–١٠ : المخالفة — العدد يخالف المعدود في التذكير والتأنيث، والتمييز جمع مجرور:
      ثلاثُ دولٍ (دولة مؤنث → العدد مذكر) — NOT "ثلاثة دول"
      ثلاثةُ تقاريرَ (تقرير مذكر → العدد مؤنث) — NOT "ثلاث تقارير"
      خمسُ سنواتٍ / خمسةُ ملايينَ / عشرُ نساءٍ / عشرةُ رجالٍ
  • ١١ و١٢ : الجزآن يطابقان المعدود، والتمييز مفرد منصوب — "أحد عشر تقريراً"، "إحدى عشرة دولةً".
  • ١٣–١٩ : الجزء الأول يخالف والجزء الثاني (عشر/عشرة) يطابق، والتمييز مفرد منصوب —
      "خمس عشرة دولةً"، "خمسة عشر تقريراً".
  • ألفاظ العقود (٢٠–٩٠) : بلفظ واحد للمذكر والمؤنث، والتمييز مفرد منصوب —
      "عشرون دولةً"، "ثلاثون تقريراً".
  • المئة والألف والمليون والمليار : التمييز مفرد مجرور —
      "مئةُ دولةٍ"، "ألفُ لاجئٍ"، "ثلاثةُ ملايينِ طفلٍ".
  • النسبة المئوية تُقرأ "في المائة" — write ٪ after the figure (٨٫٢٪) or spell "في المائة".
  • Dates/years: "عام ٢٠٢٥" (يُقرأ: ألفين وخمسة وعشرين). Never mix Latin digits into a date.
  SELF-CHECK: before returning, re-read every number in the script together with the word that
  follows it and verify the gender agreement above. A wrong عدد/معدود agreement is a critical error
  because trainee interpreters learn the numbers from this text.
- FACTUAL HONESTY — NO HALLUCINATED FIGURES OR SOURCES: never attribute an invented statistic,
  report title, resolution number or quotation to a real organisation. If you are not certain of a
  figure, use an explicit approximation ("نحو"، "قرابة"، "وفق تقديرات الأمم المتحدة") or a range,
  and never cite a specific report/resolution/date you are not sure exists.

#   2. give the student a one-click verification link per term in the glossary

REFERENCE TERMINOLOGY BASES — AUTHORITY ORDER (MANDATORY):
Every equivalent you produce must be the form ATTESTED in these institutional bases,
never an improvised or literal translation. Follow this order of authority:
  1. UNTERM (United Nations terminology database, unterm.un.org) — the authority for
     UN bodies, programmes, conventions, mandates and UN-system usage, in AR/FR/EN.
  2. IATE (iate.europa.eu) and EuroVoc (eur-lex.europa.eu/browse/eurovoc.html) —
     the authority for EU institutional, legal, economic and policy terminology (FR/EN).
  3. FranceTerme (culture.fr/franceterme) — the authority for officially recommended
     FRENCH terms (Commission d'enrichissement de la langue française), especially for
     technology, economics and neologisms; prefer the recommended French term over an
     anglicism.
  4. Vitrine linguistique / Grand dictionnaire terminologique of the Office québécois de
     la langue française — the authority for French technical usage when FranceTerme has
     no entry.
  5. ETIB-CERTTAL terminology base (etib-certtal-terminologie.usj.edu.lb) — the ETIB/USJ
     in-house Arabic base; prefer its Arabic equivalents for Lebanon/region-specific and
     academic usage when they differ from a generic rendering.
If two bases disagree, prefer the one that owns the domain (UNTERM for UN matters,
IATE/EuroVoc for EU matters, FranceTerme/OQLF for general French usage).
If you are NOT confident an equivalent is the attested institutional form, still give your
best equivalent, but keep the "definition" field precise enough that the student can verify
it — never invent an official-sounding name for a body, treaty or programme that you are
not sure exists.

Rules:
- mcqs: write 5 questions that test SPECIFIC content from the speech; every question MUST be answerable from the speech alone; the 3 wrong options must be plausible but clearly contradicted by the speech.
- glossary: 12-18 key domain-specific terms, each with correct Arabic, French, English and a brief definition. Use official UN/UNTERM institutional terminology (e.g. UNHCR → "مفوضية الأمم المتحدة السامية لشؤون اللاجئين" / "Haut-Commissariat des Nations Unies pour les réfugiés (HCR)").
- summary: 3-5 complete-sentence points capturing the main content.
